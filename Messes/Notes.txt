•	Primitive Obsession.
•	Operating by Side Effect.
•	Operating by Coincidence.
* Rampant duplication.
* Many Responsibilities.
* Using switch statements or gotos.
* Lack of abstraction.


•	Getter-free coding
•	TDD as if you mean it
•	Set-based algorithms: order-independent and count-independent
•	Whole Value pattern (you might actually use this one)
•	Pure, Side-effect free, and immutable (you would use this one if the language made it easier)
* Classes are operations; methods are results; noun classes are only facades.


DbConnectionOptions.GetKeyValuePair() => switches, all low-level code (lack of abstraction)
DataTable => huge! Many responsibilities.
ArgumentParser.Parse => duplication. NIHS.
