The Gilded Rose
===============

In this kata, you will add one new piece of functionality to an existing indebted code base. The problem description is available in the comment block at the top of the main class file, or in the [project main page](http://arlobelshee.github.com/GildedRose/).

The intention is to get your feet wet with refactoring indebted code. Additionally, see if you can identify what makes this code hard to work with, both in particular examples and in terms of the anti-patterns present within it.

More details are available on the project page.
